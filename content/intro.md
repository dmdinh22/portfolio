I'm a Software Engineer for [CCC Information Services] in Orange County, CA - previously at [InBody USA]. I have a passion for learning new things, and I always yearn to challenge my limits. I have experience in ASP .NET, Node.js, and am currently learning Java. In my free time, I enjoy tackling online coding challenges, or reading technical books and articles to expand my knowledge-base. 

Here are some live examples of my [work](#work). Have a question? Drop a line [here](#contact).
